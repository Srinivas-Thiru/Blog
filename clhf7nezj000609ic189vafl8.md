Hey there!

I'm Srinivas, and I recently made the exciting switch from biotechnology to computer science. If you're like me, with a background in a completely different field, you might be hesitant about making the change. But, I'm here to share my story and inspire others who are considering a similar career change. Don't worry, it's just a 2-3min read.

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Why did I start blogging?</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">Well, I wanted to document my learning process and reflect on my experiences as I navigate this exciting new field. I believe that when you start learning in public, you become accountable, responsible, and consistent, and I encourage more people to do the same.</div></details>

Now, let's talk about how I overcame my hesitations about programming. Like many non-CS students, I was hesitant to learn to program at first. But I decided to give it a try by taking the CS50 course by David J Malan when my dad asked why not software engineering. I'm not sure if it was the way he taught or my interest in programming, but the course was the main reason that changed my mind to go down this path.

> "In short, I am so glad that I decided to switch to computer science. If you're considering a similar career change, I 💯 encourage you to pursue it."

So, I started with the language C, wrote my very first line of code😍 `printf("Hello, World!");` and properly did all the assignments they gave in CS50, which gave me a basic understanding and the confidence that I could complete a graduate program in CS. From there, I enrolled in a Udemy course called Complete Web Development, which taught me about HTML, CSS, JS, and other frameworks. After that, I applied for a master's in CS in the United States and fortunately, I got an admit.

Since I moved to the United States, I have continued to learn Front-end Development, Back-end Development, and other concepts from open resources like [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [edx](https://www.edx.org/). While some concepts were initially hard to grasp, I believe that, with enough time, everyone can learn and understand them.

Currently, I am actively applying for internships for this fall as I graduate this December, and as part of my preparation for interviews, I'm refreshing my basic knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms while also learning Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms. I hope that my blogs about what, how, and where I learn will help fellow beginners like me in any way.

Wish me luck, and I encourage you to pursue your passions and make that career change if you're considering it!
